# Earned-Schedule-Tool

Traditionally SPI (Schedule Performance Index) does not consider the critical path and it becomes a bigger problem when project slips in time. Furthermore, SPI becomes unable to provide a clear picture of the real status of the project.

Even in delayed projects, SPI (Earned Value / Planned Value) will always end up with value = 1, since its calculation is currency based ($).

In order to overcome this problem, Earned Schedule can show effectively how much of the project has been done, since its calculation is time based (t).
